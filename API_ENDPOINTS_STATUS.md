## 🔧 **RECENT FIXES APPLIED**

### 1. Docker Rebuild Rule ✅
- Created `.cursor/rules/docker-rebuild-rule.mdc` to ensure proper container recreation after code changes

### 2. Centralized API Configuration ✅
- Created `transfer-app-ui/src/app/config/api.config.ts` for centralized endpoint management
- Updated `api.service.ts` and `auth.service.ts` to use the configuration

### 3. Database Data Type Fix ✅
- **Issue**: Multiple columns were `integer` type in PostgreSQL but C# models expected `boolean`
- **Root Cause**: Initial migration was created for SQLite but application uses PostgreSQL
- **Fix**: Manually converted columns from `integer` to `boolean` using SQL ALTER TABLE commands:
  - `Vacancies.IsDifficultStation`: integer → boolean ✅
  - `CoupleApplications.IsActive`: integer → boolean ✅
- **Result**: All import operations and queries now work without data type mismatch errors

### 4. Auto-increment Configuration ✅
- Applied `ValueGeneratedOnAdd()` to all ID properties in DbContext
- Created PostgreSQL sequences for auto-increment functionality
- Domain models remain clean without infrastructure annotations

### 5. PDF Preferences Extraction Improvement ✅
- **Enhanced**: PDF parsing now extracts columns 2 (Institute) and 3 (Post & Designation) instead of entire rows
- **Smart Matching**: Automatically matches extracted preferences with database vacancies using fuzzy matching
- **Better Response**: Returns matched preferences with database IDs, names, and match status
- **Improved Parsing**: Better line detection and column extraction logic

### 6. Authentication and User ID Fix ✅
- **Issue**: Doctor login was not storing doctor ID, causing preferences to use wrong user ID
- **Fix**: Updated AuthService to store and retrieve doctor ID from login response
- **Enhanced**: Preferences component now automatically uses logged-in doctor's merit rank
- **Security**: Added authentication checks to prevent unauthorized access to preferences
- **UX**: Merit rank input is disabled for logged-in doctors, enabled for admin users

### 7. PDF Preferences Frontend Fix ✅
- **Issue**: Frontend was using old property names (`station`, `department`) causing "toLowerCase" errors
- **Fix**: Updated frontend `ExtractedPreference` interface to match backend response format
- **Enhanced**: Frontend now properly displays `Institute`, `Post & Designation`, and `Raw Line` data
- **Feature**: Shows matched vacancy information when backend successfully matches preferences
- **Result**: PDF preferences extraction now works end-to-end without frontend errors

### 8. PDF Preferences Parsing Algorithm Rewrite ✅
- **Issue**: Previous column-based parsing was too rigid and error-prone
- **New Approach**: Database-driven matching using unique vacancy values from database
- **Algorithm**: 
  1. Extract all text from PDF (page 7 onwards)
  2. Get unique vacancy values from database (designation + institution + district)
  3. Search for these vacancy values in extracted text
  4. Identify hospital names from text before matched vacancies
- **Benefits**: More accurate matching, handles various PDF formats, uses actual database data
- **Fallback**: If no matches found, extracts meaningful lines as preferences

### 9. PDF Preferences Smart Designation Matching ✅
- **Issue**: Previous approach was still too complex and error-prone
- **New Algorithm**: 
  1. Extract available designations from database (ordered by length - longest first)
  2. For each PDF line, find the longest matching designation
  3. Extract hospital name from everything before the first space of the matched designation
  4. Example: "282-LKL0000851U201 KALMUNAI NORTH BH MO RADIOLOGY 1" 
     - Matches "MO RADIOLOGY" (longest designation)
     - Hospital: "KALMUNAI NORTH BH" (before first space of "MO RADIOLOGY")
     - Designation: "MO RADIOLOGY"
- **Benefits**: Much more accurate, handles various PDF formats, simple and reliable logic
- **Performance**: Designations are cached and only updated when vacancy list changes

### 10. PDF Preferences Hospital Name Extraction Fix ✅
- **Issue**: Hospital names were being extracted incorrectly (e.g., just "HOSPITAL" instead of "PERADENIYA TEACHING HOSPITAL")
- **Root Cause**: Complex logic trying to find last spaces was too error-prone
- **New Logic**: Simple and accurate approach:
  1. Find the designation in the line
  2. Skip the ID part (like "17-LKY0001016U104")
  3. Extract everything between ID and designation as hospital name
- **Example**: "17-LKY0001016U104 PERADENIYA TEACHING HOSPITAL MO ICU 1"
  - ID: "17-LKY0001016U104" (skipped)
  - Hospital: "PERADENIYA TEACHING HOSPITAL" (extracted)
  - Designation: "MO ICU" (matched from database)
- **Result**: Much more accurate hospital name extraction

### 11. PDF Preferences Save Fix & Frontend Performance Enhancement ✅
- **Issue 1**: Saving preferences failed with 500 error due to duplicate key constraint violation
- **Fix**: Added duplicate removal logic in backend before saving preferences
- **Issue 2**: Frontend became unresponsive with thousands of DOM elements after PDF parsing
- **Solution**: Implemented virtual scrolling using Angular CDK ScrollingModule
- **Performance Improvements**:
  - Virtual scrolling renders only visible items (600px viewport height)
  - Configurable buffer sizes for smooth scrolling
  - Memory usage reduced from O(n) to O(1) for large preference lists
- **UI Enhancements**: Modern gradient design, responsive layout, improved styling

### 12. PDF Preferences Duplicate Detection & Statistics Dashboard ✅
- **Issue**: Users needed better visibility into extracted preferences and duplicate detection
- **Backend Fix**: API now returns 400 Bad Request with detailed duplicate information instead of silently removing duplicates
- **Frontend Enhancement**: Added comprehensive statistics dashboard showing:
  - **Total Recognized**: Total number of preferences extracted from PDF
  - **Auto-Matched**: Number of preferences automatically matched with database
  - **Unmatched**: Number of preferences requiring manual mapping
  - **Duplicates**: Number of duplicate vacancy selections (highlighted in red)
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Frontend now checks for duplicates before sending API request
- **Real-time Updates**: Statistics update automatically as users map preferences
- **Visual Feedback**: Duplicate count highlighted with red border and background when > 0

### 13. PDF Preferences Layout & Duplicate Logic Fix ✅
- **Issue 1**: Duplicate detection logic was incorrect - counted total items vs unique items instead of actual duplicates
- **Fix**: Updated logic to properly count vacancy IDs that appear more than once
- **Issue 2**: Virtual scrolling item height was too large (120px) making it inefficient
- **Fix**: Reduced item height to 80px and reorganized layout to be more compact
- **Layout Improvement**: Changed from side-by-side to vertical layout:
  - **Before**: Extracted info and vacancy mapping were side by side (wide items)
  - **After**: "Map to Vacancy" dropdown now appears below the extracted details (compact items)
- **Benefits**: Better virtual scrolling performance, more compact display, clearer duplicate detection

### 14. PDF Preferences Duplicate Popup & Vacancy Mapping Fix ✅
- **Issue 1**: Users needed detailed view of duplicate preferences to understand what needs to be fixed
- **Solution**: Added clickable duplicates indicator card that opens a detailed popup
- **Popup Features**:
  - Shows each duplicated vacancy with its name and selection count
  - Red gradient header with close button
  - Responsive design for mobile devices
  - Click outside to close functionality
- **Issue 2**: Backend-matched preferences were not properly showing in the "Map to Vacancy" dropdown
- **Root Cause**: Timing issue - vacancies were loaded after preferences were mapped
- **Fix**: Ensured vacancies are loaded before processing PDF preferences
- **Enhanced Logic**: Improved vacancy matching to prioritize backend matches over fuzzy matching
- **Benefits**: Better user experience with clear duplicate information, accurate vacancy mapping for backend-matched preferences

### 15. PDF Preferences Searchable Dropdown & Enhanced Matching ✅
- **Issue 1**: Simple HTML select dropdowns were not user-friendly for large vacancy lists (500+ vacancies)
- **Solution**: Replaced with custom searchable dropdowns with real-time filtering
- **Searchable Dropdown Features**:
  - Search input field for filtering vacancies by designation, institution, or district
  - Real-time filtering as user types
  - Click outside to close functionality
  - Visual feedback for selected items
  - Responsive design with proper z-index handling
- **Issue 2**: Vacancy matching was still not working correctly for backend-matched preferences
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Added comprehensive console logging to track matching process
- **Improved Logic**: Better handling of backend matches vs fuzzy matches
- **Benefits**: Much better user experience for large vacancy lists, easier to find specific vacancies, improved debugging capabilities

### 16. PDF Preferences Logic Improvements (User Applied) ✅
- **Frontend Logic Fixes**: User has improved the vacancy matching logic in the frontend component
- **Backend Logic Fixes**: User has enhanced the PDF parsing and preference matching algorithms
- **Status**: Both frontend and backend logic improvements have been applied and tested
- **Result**: Enhanced accuracy and performance for PDF preference extraction and matching
